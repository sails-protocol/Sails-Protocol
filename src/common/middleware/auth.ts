 * Ed25519 Auth Middleware — fixes RED_TEAM_REVIEW.md RT-002 and the #1

 * raw `userId` in the request body with zero proof the caller controlled
 * that identity's keypair. This is the actual fix, not just the flag.
 *
 * Flow (challenge-response, PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md §1.1's IdentityProof):
 *   1. Client requests a challenge for their claimed publicKey
 *   2. Server issues a random nonce, stored in Redis with a short TTL
 *   3. Client signs the nonce with their Ed25519 secret key
 *   4. Client sends { publicKey, signature } on every subsequent request
 *   5. This middleware verifies the signature against a per-request nonce
 *      header — never trusts a bare userId again
